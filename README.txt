Author's Note:

To avoid confusion the author named the subdirectories according to their contents. The subdirectories are as follows:

The sp* files are the files created by JCreator (continue reading)

VisualCryptography - although a jar file is already included inside the Runnable directory I also bother to include these directory which I used in creating the application it was meant for students who will continue my study (well if there is???). It is actually the workspace created by JCreator. I did not bother to include the eclipse version well if you like please e-mail me at laizzez_faire07@yahoo.com

documentation - contains the Java API documentation of the application

documents - the various documents that were submitted to the adviser, ie. the SP, article, abstract, etc.

images - contains screenshots of the applications and the test results in resizing participant images and varying the font sizes.

Runnable - contains a runnable version of the application just click the batch file to activate. Note there is a README file inside please bother to read, that's why it's there. There is also a jar file contain inside.

*the makeDoc and makeJar file are the files which I used to create the documentation and the jar file of the application, feel free to use.

For faster exportation I also included a zip version it will unzip all the specified folders necessary in extending the application. Images, documentation and documents directory are not included.
